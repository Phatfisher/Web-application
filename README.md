# Web-application
This is my first MVC web application. In this web application I worked mainly with Bootstrap4, C#, HTML5. My web application has three main projects that I worked on. With the first being a multiplication table, where the user inputs two values between 1 and 12, and the page redirects to a new page highlighting the values given, along with the product of the two. The second project that I included in my web application was a process where given a url, the page would redirect to a new page which would show the images from the given url. This process I worked more with the backend(C#) to get the  tags from the html page from the given url. Some problems do exits here still processing certain images. The third and last project I included in my project was user friendly error handling. In this project I handled errors when given values out of the table in the multiplication table and given url's that don't exist by creating userfriendly redirection pages. I created two different error pages, one for more generic errors and one for not found(a url that doesn't exist). All of these projects I worked a lot with C#, HTML, and Bootstrap.
